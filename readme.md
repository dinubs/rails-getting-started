# Getting Started With Radcircle Development


### Learning

**Online Resources**

* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) - Ruby and Ruby on Rails
* [Code School - Ruby Course](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby) - Ruby and some Ruby on Rails
* [Team Treehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com) - Ruby on Rails (must have account, but there is a 14 day free trial)
* [Go Rails](https://gorails.com/) - Free rails screencasts, very helpful, especially the early ones

**Books**

* [Learn to Program](http://users.edpnet.be/shinobi/Ruby/Learn%20to%20Program%20%28Pragmatic%20Programmers%29_0976694042.pdf) - Goes over the ruby programming language, if you can find the second edition online that's going to be a little better, but for the fundamentals this one will do.
* [Agile Web Development with Rails 4](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Facets-Ruby/dp/1937785564/) - this book is the most recent and will go totally in depth with Rails, even if you don't use it for learning, it's still a great resource.

### What Radcircle Uses

**Environment**

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - Please use this so we don't run into any errors with people not being able to add to Radcircle. Directions on installing can be found in the Radcircle Development Repo on Github.
* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)

**Development**

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Slim Templating Engine](http://slim-lang.com/) - Please read up on slim, as it's what we use for development, and keeps the code looking cleaner. If you have trouble finding resources, Jade templating engine is similar.
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
